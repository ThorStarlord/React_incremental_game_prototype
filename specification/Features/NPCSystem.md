# Feature Specification: NPC System

## 1. Overview

The Non-Player Character (NPC) System governs the behavior, interaction, and relationships between the player and the game's inhabitants. NPCs populate the world, offer quests, provide services, and react to the player's actions.

## 6. UI Integration

*   **NPC Interaction Interface:** Dialogue boxes, trade windows, service menus.
*   **NPC Information Panel/Screen:** Displaying known information about an NPC (name, portrait, relationship status, location, associated quests).
*   **Relationship Indicators:** Visual cues (e.g., icons, color-coding) to show relationship levels.
*   **Quest Markers:** Icons above NPC heads or on maps indicating quest availability/status.

### 6.1. UI Context

Information about known NPCs and management of relationships is primarily handled within the dedicated **"NPCs" tab** in the main game interface. Direct interaction (dialogue, trade) might occur within this tab or navigate the player to the "Game/World" tab when interacting with an NPC in the game environment.
