# Feature Specification: NPC System

## 1. Overview

The Non-Player Character (NPC) System governs the behavior, interaction, and relationships between the player and the game's inhabitants. NPCs populate the world, offer quests, provide services, and react to the player's actions.

## 1.1. Naming Conventions âœ… ESTABLISHED

**Feature Folder Structure**: The NPC system follows a specific naming pattern for consistency and clarity:

- **Feature Folder**: `src/features/NPCs/` (plural)
- **Component Files**: Use singular `NPC` prefix (e.g., `NPCPanel.tsx`, `NPCHeader.tsx`, `NPCListView.tsx`)
- **State Files**: Use singular `NPC` prefix (e.g., `NPCTypes.ts`, `NPCSlice.ts`, `NPCSelectors.ts`)
- **Interface Names**: Use singular `NPC` for types (e.g., `NPC`, `NPCState`, `NPCTraitInfo`)
- **Page Components**: Use plural for page-level components (e.g., `NPCsPage.tsx`, `NpcsPage.tsx`)

**Rationale**: 
- **Folder**: `NPCs` 
- **Files**: `NPC` prefix maintains clear semantic meaning for individual entity components
- **Types**: Singular interfaces represent individual entities consistently
- **Pages**: Plural pages indicate management of multiple NPCs

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **CONSISTENTLY APPLIED** across the entire NPC feature following Feature-Sliced Design principles.

## 2. Features

*   **Dynamic Relationships:** NPCs have complex, evolving relationships with the player, influenced by player actions, dialogue choices, and quest completions.
*   **Emotional Connections (Connection Depth):** NPCs exhibit a range of emotions and can form deep connections with the player. This connection is quantified by the `connectionDepth` stat, which affects their behavior, dialogue, and contributes to passive Essence generation.
*   **Trait Sharing and Acquisition:** Players can acquire traits from NPCs (via the Resonance action, requiring sufficient Emotional Connection/Connection Depth), which can then be used to influence other NPCs or enhance the player's abilities.
*   **Social Interactions:** NPCs can interact with each other and the player in a variety of social contexts, including trading, gifting, and collaborative activities.

## 3. Technical Specifications

*   **Engine:** Built on top of the existing player and trait systems, leveraging Redux for state management and Material-UI for the interface.
*   **Data Structure:** NPC data includes fields for relationship status, emotional state, traits, and quest information.
*   **Async Operations:** Utilizes Redux Thunks for asynchronous operations, such as fetching NPC data, updating relationships, and processing interactions.

## 4. Implementation Phases

1. **Core NPC System:** Basic NPC creation, deletion, and static interaction implementation.
2. **Dynamic Relationships:** Introduction of relationship metrics, emotional states, and their impact on interactions.
3. **Trait System Integration:** Enabling trait sharing and acquisition between players and NPCs.
4. **Quest and Activity System:** Dynamic quest generation and activity participation between NPCs and players.
5. **Polish and Optimization:** Enhancements based on testing feedback, performance optimization, and bug fixing.

## 5. Testing and Validation

*   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive tests for all NPC-related functions, including relationship calculations, trait sharing, and async operations.
*   **Integration Tests:** Ensure NPC system works seamlessly with player, trait, and quest systems.
*   **User Acceptance Testing:** Feedback from real users to validate the system meets design goals and is fun to use.

## 6. UI Integration âœ… IMPLEMENTED

```typescript
interface NPCState {
  npcs: Record<string, NPC>; // Includes connectionDepth for each NPC
  discoveredNPCs: string[];
  currentInteraction: NPCInteraction | null;
  dialogueHistory: DialogueEntry[];
  relationshipChanges: RelationshipChangeEntry[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### 7.2. NPCThunks.ts

The NPCThunks file contains asynchronous thunk actions for complex NPC interactions, such as initializing NPCs, updating relationships, and processing interactions.

#### Core Thunks
```typescript
// âœ… Core async operations implemented
export const initializeNPCsThunk = createAsyncThunk<
  Record<string, NPC>,
  Record<string, NPC> | undefined,
  { state: RootState }
>('npcs/initialize', async (npcData, { rejectWithValue }) => {
  // Initialize NPCs with mock or loaded data
  // Handles data loading and error management
});

export const updateNPCRelationshipThunk = createAsyncThunk<
  { npcId: string; relationshipChange: number; newValue: number },
  { npcId: string; relationshipChange: number; reason?: string },
  { state: RootState }
>('npcs/updateRelationship', async ({ npcId, relationshipChange, reason }, { getState, rejectWithValue }) => {
  // Handles relationship updates with validation and side effects
  // Includes boundary checking and error handling
});

export const processNPCInteractionThunk = createAsyncThunk<
  InteractionResult,
  { npcId: string; interactionType: string; options?: Record<string, any> },
  { state: RootState }
>('npcs/processInteraction', async ({ npcId, interactionType, options }, { getState, dispatch, rejectWithValue }) => {
  // Complex interaction processing with relationship effects
  // Handles dialogue, gifts, quest completion, trading
  // Includes unlock rewards and essence generation
});
```

#### Example Selectors
```typescript
// âœ… New interaction types for thunk operations
export interface InteractionResult {
  success: boolean;
  relationshipChange?: number;
  essenceGained?: number;
  unlockRewards?: string[];
  message: string;
}

export interface NPCInteraction {
  npcId: string;
  startTime: number;
  interactionType: 'dialogue' | 'trade' | 'quest' | 'trait_sharing';
}

export interface RelationshipChangeEntry {
  id: string;
