# Feature Specification: NPC System

## 1. Overview

The Non-Player Character (NPC) System governs the behavior, interaction, and relationships between the player and the game's inhabitants. NPCs populate the world, offer quests, provide services, and react to the player's actions. The core of the NPC system is a two-tiered relationship model that drives player progression.

## 1.1. Naming Conventions âœ… ESTABLISHED

**Feature Folder Structure**: The NPC system follows a specific naming pattern for consistency and clarity:

- **Feature Folder**: `src/features/NPCs/` (plural)
- **Component Files**: Use singular `NPC` prefix (e.g., `NPCPanel.tsx`, `NPCHeader.tsx`, `NPCListView.tsx`)
- **State Files**: Use singular `NPC` prefix (e.g., `NPCTypes.ts`, `NPCSlice.ts`, `NPCSelectors.ts`)
- **Interface Names**: Use singular `NPC` for types (e.g., `NPC`, `NPCState`, `NPCTraitInfo`)
- **Page Components**: Use plural for page-level components (e.g., `NPCsPage.tsx`, `NpcsPage.tsx`)

**Rationale**: 
- **Folder**: `NPCs` 
- **Files**: `NPC` prefix maintains clear semantic meaning for individual entity components
- **Types**: Singular interfaces represent individual entities consistently
- **Pages**: Plural pages indicate management of multiple NPCs

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **CONSISTENTLY APPLIED** across the entire NPC feature following Feature-Sliced Design principles.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1. Two-Tiered Relationship Model âœ… IMPLEMENTED

The relationship system is now built on a "level up" mechanic, providing clear goals and satisfying progression milestones.

*   **Relationship Value (Affinity):**
    *   **Role:** Acts as the "Experience Bar" for the relationship. It's a value from 0 to 99.
    *   **Progression:** The player increases this value through positive interactions (dialogue, quests, etc.).
    *   **Gating:** Specific relationship values are still used to unlock certain interactions or tabs (e.g., trading might unlock at an Affinity of 40).

*   **Connection Depth:**
    *   **Role:** Acts as the "Level" of the relationship. This is the primary stat that influences long-term game mechanics.
    *   **Progression:** When `relationshipValue` reaches 100, it "levels up":
        1.  `connectionDepth` increases by 1.
        2.  `relationshipValue` resets to 0, allowing the progression to begin again for the next level.
    *   **Impact:** The `connectionDepth` is the primary factor used in the **Essence Generation** formula. Higher connection levels provide significant, tiered boosts to the player's passive essence gain.

*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `updateNPCRelationshipThunk` contains the core logic for this "level up" mechanic.
    *   The UI (`NPCRelationshipTab` and `NPCHeader`) visually represents the `relationshipValue` as a progress bar towards the next `connectionDepth` level.

### 2.2. Features âœ… IMPLEMENTED

*   **Dynamic Relationships:** NPCs have complex, evolving relationships with the player, influenced by player actions, dialogue choices, and quest completions. This is quantified by an "Affinity" score (Relationship Value).
*   **Emotional Connections (Connection Depth):** NPCs exhibit a range of emotions and can form deep connections with the player. This connection is quantified by the `connectionDepth` stat, which affects their behavior, dialogue, and contributes to passive Essence generation.
*   **Trait Acquisition (Resonance):** Players **permanently learn** traits *from* NPCs (traits listed in `availableTraits`) using the Resonance ability. This action costs Essence and requires proximity. The acquired trait becomes a permanent part of the player's abilities and does not need to be equipped in an active slot.
*   **Temporary Trait Attunement (Equip NPC Innate Trait):** Players can temporarily equip an NPC's `innateTraits` into one of their own active player trait slots. This provides the trait's benefits to the player while equipped, has no Essence cost, and the NPC also retains their trait.
*   **Trait Sharing:** Players can share their equipped (non-permanent) traits *with* NPCs. NPCs have a predefined number of shared trait slots (up to 5) which become usable (`isUnlocked: true`) based on meeting specific requirements (typically relationship Affinity milestones). Successful sharing depends on an available, unlocked slot on the NPC.
*   **Social Interactions:** NPCs can interact with each other and the player in a variety of social contexts, including trading, gifting, and collaborative activities.

## 3. Technical Specifications

*   **Engine:** Built on top of the existing player and trait systems, leveraging Redux for state management and Material-UI for the interface.
*   **Data Structure:** NPC data includes fields for relationship status (Affinity, Connection Depth), emotional state, `availableTraits` (traits player can Resonate for permanent acquisition), `innateTraits` (traits the NPC possesses that the player can temporarily equip), `sharedTraitSlots` (predefined, unlockable slots for traits player has shared with NPC), and quest information.
*   **Async Operations:** Utilizes Redux Thunks for asynchronous operations, such as fetching NPC data, updating relationships, and processing interactions.

## 4. Implementation Phases

### 6.1. UI Context âœ… IMPLEMENTED
(No changes needed here)
Information about known NPCs and management of relationships is primarily handled within the dedicated **"NPCs" tab** in the main game interface, located in the left navigation column. This tab utilizes the `NPCsPage` component.
- When no specific NPC is selected, `NPCsPage` displays the `NPCListView` (for browsing NPCs) occupying the full content area.
- Upon selecting an NPC, the view transitions to display the `NPCPanel` (for viewing details and interacting with the selected NPC) which also occupies the full content area. Navigation back to the list view is provided.

### 6.2. Tab-Based Interaction System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
(No changes needed here for tab structure or accessibility, only content descriptions below)

#### Tab Structure âœ… IMPLEMENTED
*   **Overview Tab:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Displays basic NPC information, relationship status, NPC's `innateTraits` (which player can equip), traits available for Resonance, and clear unlock requirements for other tabs. Key information sections are collapsible.
*   **Dialogue Tab:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Conversation interface (unlocked at relationship level 1+).
*   **Trade Tab:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Commerce interface (unlocked at relationship level 2+).
*   **Quests Tab:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Quest management (unlocked at relationship level 3+). Individual quests are collapsible.
*   **Traits Tab:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Interface for "Resonance" (permanently acquiring traits from NPC's `availableTraits`) and managing traits shared *by the player to* the NPC's `sharedTraitSlots`. (Tab unlocked at relationship level 0+, individual shared trait slots on NPC unlock based on requirements).
