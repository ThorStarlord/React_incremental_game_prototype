# Trait System Specification

This document details the design and mechanics of the Trait system, which allows players to customize their character and influence others (**including NPCs and Copies**) with passive bonuses and unique effects.

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose:** Traits provide passive modifications to character stats, abilities, or game mechanics. They allow for build diversity, character customization, and influencing NPCs/**Copies**.
*   **Core Loop:** Discover/Target -> Acquire -> Equip / Make Permanent / Share (with NPCs/**Copies**).

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **UI IMPLEMENTED** - Complete trait management interface with click-based interactions, tabbed navigation, and accessibility features.

## 2. Trait Acquisition

*   **Primary Method: Resonance (via Proximity and Essence Cost)** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Concept:** Players can acquire traits from targets (NPCs, potentially enemies, or even abstract concepts) by performing a "Resonance" action. This action requires **close proximity** to the target and the expenditure of **Essence**.
    *   **Proximity:** The player must be in close proximity to the target to perform the Resonance action.
    *   **Resonance Action:** This is the process of spending Essence to "tune into," "understand," or "copy" a trait's pattern from the target. The `Trait` data model includes an `essenceCost` property.
    *   **Current Implementation:** The `acquireTraitWithEssenceThunk` implements the Essence cost deduction and trait acquisition, gated by the player having sufficient Essence. The proximity requirement is handled in the UI or interaction logic.
*   **Other Acquisition Methods:**
    *   Completing specific quests or achievements might grant certain traits directly.
    *   (Future) Research or crafting systems could yield traits.
*   **Requirements:** Conditions needed before a trait can be acquired (applies mostly to non-resonance methods or specific resonance targets).

## 3. Trait Slots ✅ IMPLEMENTED

*   **Concept:** Players have a limited number of slots to equip active traits.
*   **Slot Configuration:** The initial number of slots, their unlocked status, and unlock requirements (e.g., by player level) are defined in the `initialState` of `TraitsSlice.ts` within `state.slots`. The maximum number of slots is defined by `state.maxTraitSlots` (currently initialized to 5).
*   **Free Trait Slots (Essence-Based):**
    *   The `TraitSlotProgressIndicator.tsx` component calculates progress towards unlocking slots based on total essence earned, suggesting this mechanic is intended. The actual unlocking is handled by the `unlockTraitSlot` action.
*   **Maximum Slots:** Currently initialized to 5 in `TraitsState.maxTraitSlots`.
*   **Equipping/Unequipping:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Handled by `equipTrait` and `unequipTrait` actions in `TraitsSlice.ts`.
*   **Management Limitation:** The player can manage trait slots (equip/unequip) only when in close proximity to an NPC from whom traits can be acquired.

### 3.1. Slot Interaction Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Click-Based System**: Replaced drag-and-drop with accessible click interactions
- **Empty Slot Click**: Opens trait selection dialog with available traits
- **Equipped Trait Click**: Directly unequips the trait with confirmation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear hover states and action indicators
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support
- **Error Prevention**: Locked slots clearly indicate unlock requirements

## 4. Trait Permanence

*   **Concept:** The player can use a special ability, likely unlocked via progression, called "Make Permanent" or similar. This ability targets an acquired trait.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Consumes a significant amount of Essence.
    *   The original acquired trait remains available to be equipped or shared if desired. *Decision in spec:* Keep the template available. (This is consistent with current slice logic).
*   **Essence Cost:**
    *   *Current Implementation:* The `makeTraitPermanentThunk` uses a flat cost (`MAKE_PERMANENT_COST` defined in `TraitThunks.ts`).
    *   *Data Model Support:* The `Trait` type includes an optional `permanenceCost?: number` field, allowing for variable costs per trait in the future.
*   **Target Scope:**
    *   Can primarily target traits the player possesses for self-permanence.
    *   *Question:* Can this ability be used on NPCs or **Copies** directly to make one of *their* traits permanent for *them*? (Potentially very powerful, needs careful consideration. Maybe a high-tier upgrade or separate ability). *Decision:* Initially, only for player self-permanence.

## 5. Trait Types & Categories

*   **Categorization:** (Standard RPG categories)
    *   `Combat`: Affecting damage, defense, speed, etc.
    *   `Physical`: Affecting health, stamina, physical resistance.
    *   `Social`: Affecting NPC interactions and relationships
*   **Rarity/Potency:** Classification affecting power, cost (acquisition/permanence), and potentially acquisition difficulty.
    *   Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary
    *   (Potentially unique/artifact tiers)

## 6. Trait List (Examples - Needs Expansion)

*   **Growing Affinity:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Trait example included in current trait definitions

- **Detailed Information**: Complete trait descriptions and effects.
- **Search/Filter**: Intended for easy navigation through trait collection.

### 7.2. Tabbed Navigation System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The trait system uses the standardized MUI tabs approach for consistent navigation:

```typescript
// ✅ Implemented tab structure
const traitTabs = [
  { id: 'slots', label: 'Equipped Traits', icon: AssignmentIcon },
  { id: 'manage', label: 'Manage Traits', icon: BuildIcon },
  { id: 'codex', label: 'Trait Codex', icon: BookIcon }
];
