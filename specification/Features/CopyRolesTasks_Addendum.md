# Copy Roles & Tasks Addendum

This addendum expands the Copy System specification to detail roles, tasks, and trait sharing automation.

## 1. Roles
- Each Copy may be assigned a role (e.g., infiltrator, guardian, artisan).
- Roles affect available tasks and trait slot unlocks.

## 2. Tasks
- Copies can be assigned tasks (e.g., gather essence, support NPC, craft item).
- Task progress tracked in Copy state.

## 3. Trait Sharing Automation
- Copies auto-sync shared traits from the player.
- Unshare occurs automatically on player unequip/replace/permanence.
