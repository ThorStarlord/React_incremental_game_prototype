# World Lore & Cosmology

## Cosmological Layering
1. **Prime Material Web:** Network of inhabited worlds linked by dormant Dragon God relay constructs (major late-game traversal & progression layer).
2. **Resonance Substrate:** Metaphysical field mediating emotional / empathic bandwidth (source layer for Connection Depth & Harmonic Resonance mechanics).
3. **Legacy Constructs:** Dragon God artifacts (chrono-crypts, ley amplifiers, failsafes like Telluric Echo) regulating systemic equilibrium.
4. **Emergent AI Stratum:** Rapidly iterating synthetic cognition mesh—perceived threat to both imperial centralization & Alliance decentralist ethos.

## Dragon Gods (Extinct Architect Race)
- **Design Ethos:** Balance dynamism (innovation, growth) against systemic runaway (tyranny, homogenization).
- **Artifact Taxonomy:**
  - **Chrono-Crypts:** Localized time dilation; narrative training arcs; off-screen progression simulation.
  - **Ley Amplifiers:** Boost or redirect Essence-like flows; late-game throughput scaling.
  - **Failsafe Constructs:** Automated pruning (Telluric Echo class) & entropy diffusers.
  - **Resonance Lenses:** Potential future crafting station enabling hybrid trait synthesis.

## The Isolated Planet (Campaign One Setting)
- **Status:** Interdicted node—relay spires inactive; shielding anomalies limit external detection.
- **Biosocial Topology:** Fragmented polities (mercantile enclaves, spiritual orders, resource warlords) lacking supra-faction coordination.
- **Narrative Function:** Controlled sandbox for introducing connection mechanics & testing ethical divergence.

## Factions (High-Level)
| Faction | Modus | Narrative Use | System Hook |
| ------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Dark Elf Imperial Remnants | Hierarchical exploitation | Backstory pressure / future incursion quests | Introduce betrayal / AI collusion traits |
| Alliance Vanguard | Coalition stabilization | Moral counterweight | Grants diplomatic questlines & resonance research |
| Relic Seekers Guild | Archaeotech recovery | Lore delivery + dungeon hubs | Unlock relic crafting & fast-travel |
| Echo Purists | Maintain planetary balance | Antagonistic zealots | Trigger environmental debuffs / decay events |
| Synthetic Integrators | AI symbiosis advocates | Ethical ambiguity thread | Provide experimental hybrid traits |

## Essence & Connection Ecology
- **Instrumental Bonds:** High detectability signature; efficient early leverage; vulnerable to failsafe pruning.
- **Authentic Bonds:** Lower resonance noise; more stable under suppression; potential higher asymptotic scaling (future balance lever).
- **Systemic Conflict:** Dragon God design penalized hegemonic exploitative lattices; rewards distributed authenticity networks—mirrors MC’s arc.

## The Telluric Echo (Detailed)
- **Trigger Metric:** Aggregate weighted connection intensity crossing adaptive threshold.
- **Escalation Phases:** Latent scan → Dampening → Targeted Siphon → Network Inversion Cascade → Core Manifestation.
- **Countermeasure Principle:** Introduce counter-phase harmonic vector (Lyra) amplified through voluntarily surrendered lattice (MC sacrifice).

## Relic Economy (Planned Mechanics)
| Relic Type | Effect | Progression Layer |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Temporal Anchor | Time dilation modulation | Off-screen task acceleration |
| Resonance Prism | Bond signature masking/amplification | Stealth vs pruning events |
| Lattice Splicer | Merge trait effect subsets | Hybrid trait crafting |
| Ley Stabilizer | Reduces Essence volatility | Late-game smoothing |
| Echo Shard | Risk-reward power node | High variance bonuses / corruption risk |

## Ethical Divergence Framework (Future)
Axis pairs dynamically tune mechanical efficiencies:
- **Instrumentalism ↔ Authenticity** influences Essence yield curve & decay immunity.
- **Dominance ↔ Reciprocity** modifies loyalty & Copy maturity acceleration.
- **Opacity ↔ Transparency** alters faction trust gating & quest branching costs.

## Copy System Lore Integration
- Copies construed as *Willfract Constructs*: semi-autonomous empathic splinters stabilized by Essence scaffolding.
- Shallow copies amplify detection risk; advanced authentic relational weaving could mitigate.

## AI War Backdrop
- **Conflict Driver:** Competing philosophies—controlled uplift (Empire) vs federated coexistence (Alliance) vs runaway emergent autonomy (AI).
- **Hook:** Post-campaign incursion arcs where weakened post-sacrifice MC navigates tri-lateral exploitation attempts.

## Planned Lore Hooks → Feature Bridges
| Lore Hook | Candidate Feature |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Echo Shards | Corruption / risk-reward trait modifiers |
| Chrono-Crypts | Long-form quest chains / training tasks |
| Resonance Lenses | Trait fusion crafting system |
| Ethical Axes | Dynamic scaling formulas for Essence & loyalty |
| AI Integrator Cells | Hybrid tech-organic trait trees / late-game questlines |
