# Key Characters

## Main Character (MC)
- **Name:** TBD (working codename: "Astraea" until finalized)
- **Origin Faction:** Dark Elf Empire (surface-dwelling schismatic branch)
- **Race:** Dark Elf (melanistic skin, bioluminescent ocular ring)
- **Core Ability:** Connection Depth — engineered empathic resonance harness translating emotional link strength into systemic leverage (buff vectors, resource throughput, trait acquisition).
- **Tactical Profile:** Strategic synthesist, excels in multi-node influence orchestration, targeted leverage extraction, adaptive social engineering.
- **Personality Baseline:** Calculating, pragmatic, incisively analytical, selectively ruthless (eschews cruelty that lacks utility). Views most bonds as transactional scaffolding.
- **Primary Vulnerability:** Underestimates emergent properties of genuine trust; initial blind spot toward authenticity as a force multiplier.
- **Narrative Arc:** Instrumental dominator → reluctant collaborator → self-sacrificial catalyst → strategically constrained rebuilder.
- **Post-Sacrifice State:** Severed from artificial lattice; must differentiate & rebuild authentic vs instrumental connections (future mechanical branching).

## Lyra
- **Faction:** Alliance Vanguard (multi-racial coalition frontline order)
- **Race:** TBD (candidate: Highborn Aetherian—photosensitive dermal lattice enabling resonance)
- **Core Ability:** Harmonic Resonance — alignment with planetary / biospheric frequency matrices; masks authentic bonds from heuristic pruning constructs (e.g., Telluric Echo).
- **Combat Profile:** Mid-range adaptive channeler; converts environmental energies into protective refractors & precision discharges.
- **Personality:** Principled, valor-forward, empathically disciplined. Idealistic yet systems-literate (not naive).
- **Arc:** Ideological adversary → contained foil → dialectic counterpart → moral validator & amplifying lens.
- **Motivational Shift:** From stopping a threat vector (MC) to preserving a strategic asset with latent redemptive scalability.

## Telluric Echo (Antagonistic System Entity)
- **Classification:** Autonomous planetary failsafe (Dragon God origin suite component).
- **Function:** Detects rising concentration of hierarchical empathic control networks; enacts pruning via resonance destabilization & connection attrition.
- **Behavioral Model:** Threshold-triggered escalation phases; initially passive dampening → targeted siphon → full-spectrum lattice inversion.
- **Weakness Vector:** Vulnerable to counter-phase harmonic injection (requires dual-channel authenticity + network amplitude: MC + Lyra cooperation).

## Dark Elf Rival Faction (Background)
- **Role:** Orchestrated MC betrayal; seeks to weaponize emergent AI for imperial leverage.
- **Future Hook:** May deploy retrieval or termination unit upon detecting MC’s post-sacrifice vulnerability.

## Alliance Command Triad (Collective NPC Set)
- **Composition:** Strategist, Moral Arbiter, Operative Liaison.
- **Conflict Vector:** Internal debate over integration vs containment of MC. Provides questline branching (trust accrual vs covert surveillance deflection).

## Potential Supporting NPC Archetypes (For Expansion)
| Archetype | Function | System Hook |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Exiled Relic Cartographer | Guides dungeon/relic chains | Unlocks fast-travel / relic crafting |
| Dissident Echo Fragment Host | Moral ambiguity encounters | Conditional debuff removal / power trade-offs |
| AI-Sympathizer Smuggler | Cross-thread narrative bridge | Early warning quests / black market traits |
| Post-Sacrifice Loyalist Remnant | Tests authenticity claims | Rebuilds reduced Essence throughput |

## Relationship Axes (Mechanical Overlay)
- **Instrumentalism ↔ Authenticity** (affects Essence efficiency curve)
- **Dominance ↔ Reciprocity** (modifies Copy loyalty growth dynamics)
- **Secrecy ↔ Transparency** (impacts quest branching & NPC suspicion meters)

## Character Progression Flags
- Milestone: First authentic (non-instrumental) bond formation (Lyra) unlocks alternative Essence scaling formula.
- Milestone: Post-sacrifice authenticity threshold reached → unlocks hybrid resonance traits (combined MC/Lyra signature).
- Milestone: Alliance trust composite > threshold → access to interplanetary campaign arc.
