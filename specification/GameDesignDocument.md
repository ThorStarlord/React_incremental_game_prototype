## 5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

### 5.1. UI Overview

The game will feature a clean and intuitive user interface designed for clarity and ease of use. Key information like player resources (Essence) and core stats will be persistently visible.

The main game interface utilizes a **vertical side-tab layout** (implemented via `VerticalNavBar` and `MainContentArea`) to organize major systems. A navigation bar on the left contains tabs for different game sections. Clicking a tab displays its corresponding content in the main area to the right. Primary tabs include:

*   **Game:** The main viewport for exploration, combat, and direct interaction.
*   **Character:** Displays player stats, attributes, etc.
*   **Traits:** Managing acquired and equipped character traits.
*   **NPCs:** Viewing information about non-player characters and managing relationships. *(Placeholder)*
*   **Settings:** Accessing game configuration options.
*   *(Potentially others like Inventory, Quests, Minions/Copies, World Map)*

This layout allows for focused management of different game aspects. The sidebar can be made collapsible to maximize the main content view. A persistent header is currently omitted, but global resources might be displayed within the main content area's header or the sidebar itself. The UI will be designed with responsiveness in mind.

### 5.2. Key UI Elements

*   **Essence Display:** Clearly shows current/max essence and potentially generation rate (e.g., in `MainContentArea` header).
*   **Trait Management:** Interface (`TraitSystemWrapper`) within the main content area when the "Traits" tab is active.
*   **NPC Codex/List:** Interface within the main content area when the "NPCs" tab is active. *(Placeholder)*
*   **Action Buttons/Bars:** Contextual buttons for interaction, skills, or items (likely within the "Game" tab's content - `GamePage`).
*   **Notifications:** Non-intrusive pop-ups for important events (trait acquired, level up, quest updates).
*   **Tooltips:** Providing detailed information on hover for stats, traits, items, etc.
