## React Incremental RPG Prototype

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** Current  
**Status:** Living Document

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

The React Incremental RPG Prototype is an experimental incremental game that explores emotional connection mechanics as the core progression driver. Unlike traditional incremental games focused on numerical growth, this prototype emphasizes building meaningful relationships with NPCs to unlock character abilities and create allied entities.

### Core Innovation
The game replaces traditional "clicking for numbers" with "connecting for growth," where players invest time and emotional intelligence to build relationships that yield both mechanical benefits and narrative depth.

## ðŸŒŸ Game Concept

### Vision Statement
Create an incremental RPG where emotional intelligence and relationship building drive progression, allowing players to acquire abilities through understanding and connecting with diverse characters rather than grinding resources.

### Target Experience
Players should feel like they're building a network of meaningful relationships while gradually becoming more capable through the wisdom and abilities gained from these connections.

### Unique Selling Points
1. **Emotional Connection Mechanics** - Relationships as primary progression currency
2. **Trait Acquisition System** - Learn abilities from NPCs through understanding
3. **Copy Creation** - Transform deep connections into allied entities
4. **Essence Economy** - Metaphysical resource generated from emotional bonds
5. **Character Customization** - Build unique character combinations through relationship choices

## ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay Loop

### Primary Loop (5-10 minutes)
1. **Discover NPCs** - Encounter new characters with unique traits and personalities
2. **Build Relationships** - Engage in dialogue and activities to deepen connections
3. **Generate Essence** - Passive resource generation from active emotional connections
4. **Acquire Traits** - Spend Essence to learn abilities from connected NPCs

5. **System Mastery** - Optimize Essence generation and trait acquisition strategies

## ðŸ§  Core Mechanics

### Emotional Connection System
**Concept**: The foundation of all progression, representing the depth of understanding and bond between player and NPCs. This connection is crucial for unlocking interactions and generating Essence.

**Implementation**:
- **Connection Depth** - Numerical representation of relationship strength (0-100). This is the primary stat for tracking Emotional Connection.
- **Connection Quality** - Categorical assessment of relationship type (friendship, mentorship, rivalry) - *Planned for future implementation.*
- **Essence Generation** - Passive resource production directly linked to the `connectionDepth` of active emotional connections.
- **Unlock Gates** - Deeper connections unlock new interaction options and content (e.g., tabs in the NPC panel).

**Player Actions**:
- Engage in meaningful dialogue choices that resonate with NPC personalities
- Complete personal quests or favors that matter to the NPC
- Share beneficial traits to demonstrate care and investment
- Spend time in activities the NPC enjoys or values

**Player Actions**:
- Engage in meaningful dialogue choices that resonate with NPC personalities
- Complete personal quests or favors that matter to the NPC
- Share beneficial traits to demonstrate care and investment
- Spend time in activities the NPC enjoys or values

### Essence System
**Concept**: Metaphysical currency representing emotional energy and potential for growth. Essence is the primary resource for advanced actions and progression.

**Generation**:
- **Passive Income** - Continuous generation directly from the `connectionDepth` of all active emotional connections.
- **Connection Depth Influence** - Higher `connectionDepth` with NPCs leads to increased passive Essence generation.
- **NPC Uniqueness** - More complex or powerful NPCs provide higher base generation rates for their connections.
- **Manual Actions** - Limited direct generation through focused actions (e.g., clicking a button).
- **Trait Multipliers** - Certain player traits can increase the overall Essence generation rate.

**Consumption**:
- **Trait Acquisition (Resonance)** - Primary Essence sink for learning new abilities from NPCs. This is the "Resonance" action.
- **Trait Permanence** - Major investment to make traits always active without slot usage.
- **Copy Acceleration** - Speed up entity creation and development.
- **Emotional Influence** - Direct manipulation of NPC emotional states - *Planned for future implementation.*

**Consumption**:
- **Trait Acquisition** - Primary Essence sink for learning new abilities
- **Trait Permanence** - Major investment to make traits always active
- **Copy Acceleration** - Speed up entity creation and development
- **Emotional Influence** - Direct manipulation of NPC emotional states

### Trait System
**Concept**: Abilities, characteristics, and passive bonuses that define character capabilities. Traits are acquired from NPCs and equipped to enhance the player.

**Acquisition Methods**:
- **Resonance** - The primary method for acquiring traits. This is an **action** where the player spends **Essence** to copy an observed trait from an NPC. This action requires a sufficient level of **Emotional Connection** (`connectionDepth`) with the NPC.
- **Quest Rewards** - Direct grants from significant achievements.
- **Research** - Future system for discovering abstract or unique traits.
- **Copy Inheritance** - Traits passed to created entities.

**Management**:
- **Limited Slots** - Players start with few trait slots, unlock more through progression
- **Permanent Traits** - Expensive option to make traits always active without slot usage
- **Trait Categories** - Combat, Social, Physical, Mental traits with different applications
- **Synergy Systems** - Future combinations and interactions between traits

### NPC Interaction System
**Concept**: Rich interaction framework supporting diverse relationship types and progression paths.

**Relationship Progression**:
- **Discovery Phase** - Initial NPC encounter and basic information gathering
- **Acquaintance Level** - Basic dialogue and simple trait observation
- **Friend Level** - Deeper conversations, quest access, trait acquisition options
- **Close Bond** - Advanced interactions, trait sharing, emotional influence
- **Deep Connection** - Copy creation potential, permanent trait options, unique content

**Interaction Types**:
- **Dialogue Systems** - Branching conversations with personality-aware responses
- **Activity Participation** - Join NPCs in activities they enjoy or need help with
- **Gift Systems** - Share resources, traits, or assistance meaningful to the NPC
- **Conflict Resolution** - Help NPCs overcome personal challenges or problems

### Copy Creation System
**Concept**: Transform deep emotional connections into allied entities that assist the player. Copies inherit aspects of the player and their "parent" NPC.

**Creation Process**:
- **Seduction Outcome** - A successful outcome of a specific deep relationship interaction with an NPC creates the opportunity to create a Copy.
- **Growth Options** - Choose between time-intensive natural growth or Essence-accelerated development.
- **Trait Inheritance** - A new Copy inherits a snapshot of traits the player had actively shared with the parent NPC at the moment of creation.
- **Loyalty System** - Ongoing relationship maintenance is required for reliable Copy behavior.

**Inheritance**:
- **Emotional Resonance (Player Ability):** Copies inherit the player's core "Emotional Resonance" ability. This is a planned player characteristic that allows Copies to potentially form connections and interact with the Trait system (perhaps in a limited way initially). Its specific mechanics are currently undefined and planned for future implementation with the Copy system. **Note: This is distinct from the sidelined "Soul Resonance" concept found in `soulResonanceUtils.ts`.**
- **Shared Traits:** Copies inherit *snapshots* of any traits the player had actively shared with the *target parent* via Trait Slots *at the moment of creation*. These become the Copy's initial base traits. They do *not* automatically update if the player later changes the traits shared with the parent.
- **Player Traits:** Copies do not inherit traits the player has permanently active or equipped for themselves by default, to differentiate them from the player.

**Copy Management**:
- **Task Assignment** - Direct Copies to perform specific activities or goals.
- **Trait Sharing** - Grant additional abilities to Copies for specialized roles via dedicated Copy Trait Slots.
- **Loyalty Maintenance** - Ongoing investment required to prevent Copy independence or rebellion.
- **Capability Limits** - Maximum number of active Copies based on player progression.
