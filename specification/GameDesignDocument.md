## 5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

### 5.1. UI Overview

The game will feature a clean and intuitive user interface designed for clarity and ease of use. Key information like player resources (Essence) and core stats will be persistently visible.

The main game interface will utilize a **tabbed layout** to organize major systems. Primary tabs will likely include:

*   **Game/World:** The main viewport for exploration, combat, and direct interaction.
*   **Traits:** Managing acquired and equipped character traits.
*   **NPCs:** Viewing information about non-player characters and managing relationships.
*   *(Potentially others like Inventory, Quests, Settings)*

This tabbed approach allows for focused management of different game aspects while keeping the main game view uncluttered. A persistent header or sidebar will display global resources and provide access to the main menu. The UI will be designed with responsiveness in mind to adapt to various screen sizes.

### 5.2. Key UI Elements

*   **Essence Display:** Clearly shows current/max essence and potentially generation rate.
*   **Trait Management:** Interface within the "Traits" tab for viewing, equipping, and managing traits and slots.
*   **NPC Codex/List:** Interface within the "NPCs" tab for browsing known NPCs and their details.
*   **Action Buttons/Bars:** Contextual buttons for interaction, skills, or items (likely within the "Game/World" tab or a bottom bar).
*   **Notifications:** Non-intrusive pop-ups for important events (trait acquired, level up, quest updates).
*   **Tooltips:** Providing detailed information on hover for stats, traits, items, etc.
