*   **FR-LAYOUT-010:** âœ… **NEWLY IMPLEMENTED** - The system shall demonstrate mature software architecture practices through comprehensive component lifecycle management including deprecation, migration, and removal planning.

**Implementation Notes**:
- âœ… **Deprecation Strategy**: Complete implementation of legacy component deprecation with comprehensive warning systems and migration guidance
- âœ… **Runtime Warnings**: Console warnings alert developers to deprecated component usage during development
- âœ… **Visual Alerts**: Deprecated components display Material-UI Alert components with clear migration information
- âœ… **JSDoc Documentation**: Comprehensive deprecation annotations with migration paths and architectural benefits
- âœ… **Graceful Degradation**: Legacy components continue functioning while providing clear migration guidance
- âœ… **Future Removal Preparation**: Components structured for clean removal with minimal disruption
- âœ… **Developer Experience**: Clear migration paths reduce refactoring complexity and improve productivity
- âœ… **Performance Consideration**: Deprecation warnings optimized for development environment only

### ðŸ”„ Partially Implemented
1. **Trait System Backend** - UI complete, backend mechanics integration pending
2. **Player Character Backend** - âœ… **UI NOW FULLY COMPLETE**, backend action integration ready for enhancement
3. **NPC System Backend** - UI complete, advanced backend mechanics integration pending

### ðŸ“‹ Planned for Future Implementation
1. **Copy System** - Complete feature implementation (comprehensive shell ready)
2. **Quest System Backend** - Enhanced quest mechanics (UI framework ready)
3. **Core Gameplay Loop** - Emotional connections and essence generation
4. **Advanced NPC Interactions** - Backend integration for relationship mechanics
5. **Attribute Point Allocation** - Point spending interface for character progression
6. **Skills System** - Complete skill trees and progression (comprehensive shell ready)
7. **Legacy Component Removal** - âœ… **SCHEDULED** - Complete removal of deprecated layout components after migration verification

**Player System Success**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - The Player system demonstrates comprehensive React component architecture with progression mechanics focused on attribute development, skill advancement, and trait integration rather than traditional leveling systems.
