# User Flows Specification

This document outlines the key user interaction flows and navigation patterns within the React Incremental RPG Prototype.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Core navigation flows implemented with responsive design, complete GameLayout integration, **and ✅ NEWLY IMPLEMENTED AppRouter coordination**.

## 1. Application Entry and Navigation ✅ COMPLETE + ROUTER-INTEGRATION

### 1.1. Main Application Flow ✅ NEWLY ENHANCED + ROUTER-INTEGRATION

**Route-Based Navigation**: ✅ **COMPLETE WITH GAMELAYOUT + APPROUTER INTEGRATION**

```
User Access → AppRouter Evaluation → Route Delegation → Interface Rendering
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                  ↓
   URL Entry   → Route Matching    → Component Selection → Layout Rendering
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                  ↓
  "/" or "/menu → MainMenu Route   → MainMenu Component → Standalone Interface
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                  ↓
"/game/*"     → GameLayout Route → GameLayout Component → Complete Game Interface
```

#### AppRouter Integration Benefits ✅ NEWLY ACHIEVED

**Simplified Navigation Architecture**:
- **Single Game Route**: All game functionality accessed through `/game/*` route delegation to GameLayout
- **Clean Separation**: MainMenu and Game interface completely separated at router level
- **Route Delegation**: GameLayout handles all internal navigation without router involvement
- **Performance**: Single route evaluation for all game functionality eliminates routing overhead
- **User Experience**: Smooth navigation without unnecessary route changes during game interaction

### 1.2. Game Interface Navigation Flow ✅ ENHANCED + ROUTER-INTEGRATION

**GameLayout Internal Navigation**: ✅ **COMPLETE WITH APPROUTER DELEGATION**

```
GameLayout Mount → Initial State Setup → Navigation Ready → User Interaction
      ↓                   ↓                 ↓                ↓
  Route Delegation  → useLayoutState    → Tab System    → Content Updates
      ↓                   ↓                 ↓                ↓
  /game/* received  → Layout State Init → Default Tab   → MainContentArea
      ↓                   ↓                 ↓                ↓
  GameLayout Active → Navigation Ready  → User Clicks   → Internal Navigation
```

#### Internal Navigation Benefits ✅ NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**Performance-Optimized Flow**:
- **No Route Changes**: Tab navigation handled internally without browser navigation
- **Component Stability**: GameLayout remains mounted during all internal navigation
- **State Persistence**: Navigation preferences persist without URL dependency
- **Smooth Transitions**: Material-UI transitions without route evaluation overhead
- **Memory Efficiency**: Single component lifecycle for entire game interface
