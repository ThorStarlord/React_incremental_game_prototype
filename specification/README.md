# React Incremental RPG Prototype - Technical Specification

This specification documents the design, architecture, and implementation details for the React Incremental RPG Prototype. The game is built using modern React development practices with Redux Toolkit state management, Material-UI components, and TypeScript for type safety.

## 📋 Project Overview

The React Incremental RPG Prototype is an incremental/idle game featuring emotional connections, trait acquisition, and character progression. Players establish relationships with NPCs, acquire traits, and create copies while managing essence as the core resource.

### 🎯 Core Game Loop
1. **Establish Emotional Connections** with NPCs through interaction
2. **Generate Essence** passively based on connection depth
3. **Acquire Traits** from NPCs using Essence
4. **Enhance Character** through trait permanence and attribute progression
5. **Create Copies** through seduction mechanics for extended influence

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) with custom theming
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Material-UI sx prop system
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with nested layouts
- **Build Tool**: Create React App with TypeScript template

### Design Patterns
- **Feature-Sliced Design**: Modular architecture by feature domain
- **Container/Component Pattern**: Separation of logic and presentation
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with createSlice and createAsyncThunk
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction and state management
