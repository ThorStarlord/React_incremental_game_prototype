## üéØ Project Vision

The React Incremental RPG Prototype explores emotional connection mechanics in incremental gaming, where players build relationships with NPCs to unlock traits and abilities. The core gameplay loop focuses on:

1. **Emotional Connections** - Building relationships with NPCs through meaningful interactions
2. **Essence Generation** - Passive resource generation from emotional connections
3. **Trait Acquisition** - Learning abilities and characteristics from connected NPCs
4. **Character Progression** - Customizing the player character through acquired traits
5. **Copy Creation** - Creating allied entities through deep connections

## üöÄ Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Systems
- **Core Architecture** - Feature-Sliced Design with Redux Toolkit
- **Game Loop** - Timing, speed control, and auto-save functionality
- **Player Management** - Character stats, equipment, and trait integration
- **Trait System** - Complete UI with acquisition, equipment, and permanence mechanics
- **NPC Interactions** - Tabbed interface with relationship progression
- **Essence Management** - Resource tracking with generation and consumption
- **Save/Load** - Complete persistence with import/export functionality
- **Navigation** - Responsive navigation with desktop and mobile support
- **Layout System** - Modern GameLayout with comprehensive deprecation strategy

### üîÑ Partially Implemented
- **Backend Integration** - UI complete for most systems, backend mechanics pending
- **Advanced NPC Features** - Core interactions implemented, advanced mechanics planned

### üìã Planned Features
- **Quest System** - Objective tracking and narrative progression
- **Copy System** - Entity creation and management
- **Advanced Trait Mechanics** - Trait sharing and NPC enhancement
- **Emotional Connection System** - Deep relationship mechanics
