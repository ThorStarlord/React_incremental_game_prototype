# React Incremental RPG Prototype - Specification

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the React Incremental RPG Prototype, organized by domain and concern.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `/requirements/`
Defines **what** the system should do and **how** it should perform:
- **FunctionalRequirements.md** - Core game features and capabilities
- **NonFunctionalRequirements.md** - Performance, scalability, and quality attributes

### `/technical/`
Describes **how** the system is built and structured:
- **ArchitectureOverview.md** - High-level technical architecture and technology stack
- **StateManagement.md** - Redux Toolkit implementation and state structure
- **DataModel.md** - Core interfaces and data structures

### `/features/`
Detailed specifications for individual game systems:
- **GameLoopSystem.md** ‚úÖ *Implemented* - Core timing and progression engine
- **TraitSystem.md** - Character customization and influence mechanics
- **EssenceSystem.md** - Core metaphysical resource system
- **PlayerSystem.md** - Character stats, attributes, and progression
- **CopySystem.md** - Player-created entity management
- **SaveLoadSystem.md** - Game persistence and import/export
- **QuestSystem.md** - Goal-driven gameplay mechanics
- **NPCSystem.md** - Non-player character interactions and relationships

### `/UI_UX/`
User interface and experience design:
- **LayoutDesign.md** - Application layout and navigation structure
- **UserFlows.md** - Interaction patterns and user journeys

## üéØ Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Systems
- **GameLoop System** - Fixed timestep timing, speed control, auto-save
- **MUI Tabs Strategy** - Standardized tab components across all features
- **NPC System (Basic Integration)** - Redux slice added, navigation integrated, basic UI components connected.

### üöß Specified but Not Implemented
- Trait System (acquisition, permanence, sharing mechanics)
- Essence System (generation, spending, connection-based mechanics)
- Player System (stats, attributes, equipment)
- Copy System (creation, growth, management)
- Save/Load System (persistence, import/export)
- Quest System (objectives, rewards, progression)
- NPC System (Full Features) - Relationships, interactions, quests, etc.

### üìã Design Decisions

#### Tab Strategy
- **Adopted**: MUI `<Tabs>` and `<Tab>` components universally
- **Components**: `StandardTabs`, `TabPanel`, `TabContainer`
- **Hook**: `useTabs` for consistent state management
- **Benefits**: Accessibility, keyboard navigation, consistent styling

#### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Feature-Sliced Design for modularity
- **State**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- **UI**: Material-UI for consistent component library
- **Typing**: TypeScript for type safety and maintainability

## üîÑ Next Implementation Priorities

1. **Trait System** - Core character customization mechanics
2. **Essence System** - Primary resource and connection mechanics
3. **Player System** - Character stats and progression
4. **NPC System (Full Features)** - Implement relationships, interactions, quests, etc.
5. **Save/Load System** - Game persistence functionality

## üìñ Reading Guide

1. Start with `technical/ArchitectureOverview.md`
2. Review `requirements/FunctionalRequirements.md`
3. Examine individual feature specifications as needed

For **designers**:
1. Begin with `UI_UX/LayoutDesign.md`
2. Review `UI_UX/UserFlows.md`
3. Check feature specifications for UI/UX considerations

For **stakeholders**:
1. Read `GameDesignDocument.md` for high-level overview
2. Review `requirements/FunctionalRequirements.md` for system capabilities
3. Check implementation status in this README
