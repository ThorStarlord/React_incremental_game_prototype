# Context File Renaming Documentation

## Overview
This document details the renaming of the context index file from a generic `index.ts` to a more descriptive `gameContext.ts` to better reflect its purpose and content.

## Changes Made

1. **File Renamed**: 
   - `src/context/index.ts` â†’ `src/context/gameContext.ts`

2. **Rationale**:
   - The file serves as the central export point for all game context functionality
   - The name `gameContext.ts` more clearly indicates the file's purpose and content
   - Follows best practices for descriptive naming over generic index files

## Required Follow-up Changes

After renaming this file, update all imports in other files that reference this module:

### For Explicit Imports
```typescript
// Before
import { useGameState, useGameDispatch, ... } from './context';
// or
import { useGameState, useGameDispatch, ... } from './context/index';

// After
import { useGameState, useGameDispatch, ... } from './context/gameContext';
```

### For Default Imports (if any)
```typescript
// Before
import ContextExports from './context';

// After
import ContextExports from './context/gameContext';
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Readability**: More descriptive file names make the codebase easier to navigate
2. **Better IDE Support**: Searching for "game context" will now find this file directly
3. **Clearer Architecture**: File names that describe their purpose help developers understand the system architecture

## Verification Steps

After making these changes:
1. Search for all imports referencing the original file path and update them
2. Run the application to ensure all context functionality continues to work
3. Verify that TypeScript doesn't report any import errors
